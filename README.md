This is just a practice repository
Hi my name is Claudia Fuentes

### Zodiac Signs
>I am interested in the 12 different zodiac signs which are:
* [Capricorn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_(astrology))
* Aries
* [Taurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taurus_(astrology))
* [Scorpio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorpio_(astrology))
* Gemini
* Pisces
* Cancer
* Leo
* Virgo
* [Libra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libra_(astrology))
* Aquarius
* Sagittarius 

> What really interested me about them was that they can sometimes tell what the future holds. 
> The links highlighted are wikipedia links to the zodiacs that my family has which are _**Scorpio, Libra, Capricorn, and 2 are Taurus**_ 
> What also interest me are horror game analyzing and also analyzig the lore of games and their backstories as well.
#### Youtube
These are the 2 channels that I mainly watch since they deal with analyzing the backstory of video games and if some theories are correct
* [Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_IB5145EVNcf8hw1Kku7w)
* [SuperHorrorBro](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChL4WU9YLlxXXNSwlzM1-7g)

## Coding
> There are also times that I code but only for when it comes to the university classes that i'm taking.
**Like for example where I have to create a code that does a simple shape called a Turtle Image:

import turtle

Num_Circles = 20

Radius = 150

Angle = 35

Animation_Speed = 12

turtle.speed(Animation_Speed)

for x in range(Num_Circles):
    
    turtle.circle(Radius)
    turtle.left(Angle)
    
## This is an example of what can be created by using Turtle Graphics
